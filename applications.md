## Research Statements
These are bits of advice I give in response to nearly all research statements, so I decided to collect them here.

* The biggest piece of advice I have is to **consider your audience**. Most of the other tips follow from this. For academic positions (masters and PhD programs, postdocs, or faculty positions), your audience is a professor who is reading this as application #173 of 400 on little sleep with a broken coffee machine, right before a paper deadline, during a break from teaching, and with a sick child in their lap. You want the topic of study to be obvious and gripping. Enable them to absorb your impact with minimal time and effort. They will love you for it.

* **2-pages max**: Start with an executive summary paragraph, talk about what you've done for a page or so, and then talk about your future plans

* **Space out your text**: Use a decent font size (12-point), utilize line spacing, increase line spacing between your paragraphs. You've done a ton of work and you want to showcase it, but if you send me a wall of text, committees won't read or retain any of it. Showcase the highlights. During the interview, you can bring up additional projects as they become relevant.

* **Use section headers**: These should state the takeaway for each section. They will take additional space, but committee members can easily skim for takeaways and remember them after (and if not, they can easily skim to refresh on your takeaways after reading the remaining 200 applications). 

* **Use color and figures**: Most applications are entirely black and white. Adding a subtle color to your name or to section headers can be memorable and help your application stand out. Make sure the colors are legible and are not distracting. Similarly, if you can convey your findings or research agenda using a figure, it will break up the wall of text and will enable readers to quickly see what you're about. Just make sure the figures are extremely intuitive to interpret.

### Tenure-track positions
* **>=1 self-citation per section**: The statement should showcase your work and establish you as an expert to faculty who are somewhat outside your area (that's why they're hiring you). That means each section in your statement needs to serve to highlight work you've done in that area, and one way to do that is to cite work you've done in that area.

* **Limit the exposure of vaporware**: The future work section is where you can talk about your future plans. Before then, you want to establish your credentials as an expert. As much as possible, talk about work you've already done or for which you have pilot results. Avoid talking about plans outside the future plans section where possible.

* **Avoid talking about your dissertation**. You should not have this kind of phrase in your statement: "As part of my dissertation, I plan to X."  They are hiring someone who has already finished her dissertation and is blowing the world away with her brilliant work. Generally avoid talking about your dissertation and instead just talk about your work (which obviously includes work on your dissertation). If you haven't published in an area, try to at least present a figure showing to results to indicate that you're actively working on the planned stuff and publication is imminent.
