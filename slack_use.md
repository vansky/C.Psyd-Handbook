# C.Psyd Slack

We have an active lab slack with several channels. Below is the purpose of each affiliated slack channel:

+ `#a-day-at-the-beach` For suggesting, planning, or discussing lab social events
+ `#cpsyd-dailyresearch` Brief posts/conversations about each member's daily research progress
    + Every member of C.Psyd Slack is expected to regularly post to this channel
    + Traditionally, each member replies to other posts with emogen wordplay
+ `#cpsyd-general` Things that are directly relevant to the full lab
+ `#cpsyd-jobs` Relevant job adverts
+ `#cpsyd-papers` Interesting papers people find
+ `#cpsyd-random` Things that are of interest to the full lab
+ `#emogen` Announcements of new emoji creations or requests thereof
+ `#font-of-wisdom` A place for getting help or finding papers or tools that do a desired task
+ `#paper-readings` Announcements of ad hoc paper discussions (usually organized by students)
+ `#preprints-arxivcscl` Feed of daily CL/NLP Arxiv releases
    + Students interested in research should read over this each day (see [Grad Student Tips](#welcome-to-cpsyd))
+ `#tacl` Feed of recent TACL publications
    + Students interested in research should read over this when it updates (see [Grad Student Tips](#welcome-to-cpsyd))
